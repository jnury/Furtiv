# Furtiv

Furtiv is a console application wrapper for Windows. It's intended to launch command line tools (like PowerShell scripts) without displaying a window. Usefull for startup scripts and triggered user actions.

This app is based on the [Doing a NotifyIcon Program the Right Way](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/627796/Doing-a-NotifyIcon-Program-the-Right-Way) Code Project article by [Johnny J.](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=926948).

Everything is a work in progress ;-)

## How to code

This application is built with Visual Studio Community with C# WinForm features.
